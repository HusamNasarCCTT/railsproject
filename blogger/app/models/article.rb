  #Basically, telling Rails that the Article Model has the ability to have attachments....
  #And, validating the type of attachments against 3 types of image files "jpg, jpeg, and png"...
  #Paperclip gem method...

  #Developer Note:
  #As of version 4.0, all attachments are required to include a content_type validation, a file_name validation,
  #or to explicitly state that theyâ€™re not going to have either.
  #Paperclip raises MissingRequiredValidatorError error if you do not do this.
  #So, we add the validates_attachment_content_type line so that our model will validate that it is receiving a proper filetype.
